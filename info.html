            <h1>Our mission</h1>

            <p>The aims of the <b>Cambridge Popup Speakeasy</b> are to promote jazz as a cultural asset within the
                Cambridge
                community. We provide opportunities for musicians to play publicly, to network, to socialise, and to
                grow as musicians and performers.</p>

            <p>In the past couple of years we are delighted to have built a strong following - we are extremely grateful
                for your support.</p>

            <p>The evening is free to attend, and always will be. We hope you enjoy yourself!</p>

            <h1 id="donations">Donations</h1>

            <p>Please support our musicians by donating what you think is reasonable for the eveningâ€™s entertainment. We
                believe all performing musicians should receive something for sharing their talent.</p>

            <p>We organise the evenings as a public service, because we love Jazz, and we love the community.
                We do not, and never will, make any money for ourselves. Donations received by the Cambridge Popup
                Speakeasy
                are distributed fairly to all participants. Any further income (that would be a fine thing!) will be
                reinvested in the health of the speakeasy and will ultimately find its way back to our performing
                musicians, either directly or in kind.</p>

            <div class="donate-now">
                <p>If you want to support the Speakeasy now &ndash; that's awesome!</p>
