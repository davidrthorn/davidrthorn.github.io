            <h1 id="mission">Our mission</h1>

            <p>The aim of the <b>Cambridge Pop-up Speakeasy</b> is to promote jazz as a cultural asset within the
                Cambridge
                community. We provide opportunities for musicians to play publicly, to network, to socialise, and to
                grow as musicians and performers.</p>

            <p>Over the past few years we are delighted to have built a strong following &ndash; we are extremely grateful
                for your support.</p>

            <p>The evening is free to attend, and always will be. We hope you enjoy yourself!</p>

            <h1 id="donations">Donating</h1>

            <p>Please support our musicians by donating what you think is reasonable for the eveningâ€™s entertainment. We
                believe all performing musicians should receive something for sharing their talent.</p>

            <p>We organise the evenings as a public service, because we love Jazz, and we love the community.
                We do not, and never will, make any money for ourselves. Donations received by the Cambridge Popup
                Speakeasy
                are distributed fairly to all participants. Any further income (that would be a fine thing!) will be
                reinvested in the health of the speakeasy and will ultimately find its way back to our performing
                musicians, either directly or in kind.</p>

            <div class="donate-now">
                <p>If you want to support the Speakeasy now &ndash; that's awesome!</p>

                <p>We also accept donations on the night. Thank you for supporting your local jazz community.</p>

            <h1 id="performing">Want to perform?</h1>

            <p>We are constantly seeking new acts, whether individuals or established groups looking for an opportunity
                to play. We suggest you first attend as an audience member to get an idea of the format of the evening.</p>

            <p>All sets are pre-arranged; this is not a jam session. We love diversity and any style of jazz is fine
                &ndash; vocal, cool, latin, modern, fusion, afro-beat, New Orleans, Arabic, free &ndash; you name it, we've
                probably done it!</p>

            <p>The most important things are to entertain the audience and enjoy yourself.</p>

            <p><strong>Sounds good?</strong> Please go ahead and get in touch &ndash; email link at the foot of the page &ndash; we look forward to hearing from
                you!</p>
